  "overall_feedback": "The submission demonstrates a strong understanding of the project requirements and effectively addresses the customer's needs. The structure is mostly clear, and the critical points of the interview are well summarized. Grammar is good, and the next steps are outlined comprehensively. However, a recording of the interview could have added more depth to the evaluation."
