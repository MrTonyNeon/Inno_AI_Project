  "overall_feedback": "The submission demonstrates a good understanding of the interview content and relevant questions, with clear structure and relevant focus. However, it lacks visual documentation such as screenshots, and some grammatical issues slightly detract from clarity. Overall, it reflects a solid effort with room for improvement in presentation and detail."
