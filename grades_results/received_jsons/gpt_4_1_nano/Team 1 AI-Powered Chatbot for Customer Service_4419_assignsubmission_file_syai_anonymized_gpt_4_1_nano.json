  "overall_feedback": "The submission demonstrates a solid understanding of the project scope, with clear role delineation and relevant questions. The structure is generally well-organized, though minor issues with grammar and presentation could be improved. The inclusion of detailed next steps and reflection on interview insights is commendable. However, the absence of a recording and some areas where questions could be more deeply structured or specific slightly detract from the overall quality. Overall, a competent submission with room for refinement."}
